# Homework 2

# Overview
In this assignment, you'll work (or fight?) with the C++ compiler, as you dive into compiler and linker errors. You'll practice some of the memory models we saw in class. You'll also get the chance to modify existing C++ code and to write some C++ code from scratch.


# Reading
You should read the following sections of the *C++ Primer, 5th edition*, before you begin. 
* Section 2.1 about primitive data types
* Section 2.6 about defining classes and about separate compilation
* Section 6.1 (but skip section 6.1.1) about functions and separate compilation
* Section 6.2, stopping after you finish 6.2.3 about argument passing

# Steps
There are nine Issues to complete for this assignment:

* Compiler Errors Part
* Linker Errors Part
* Memory Diagram Part
* Coding Part
 * C1: Compile the Shuffle Program
 * C2: Remove count_ from the LineShuffler class
 * C3: Write the exchange function
 * C4: Add a new member function to the LineShuffler class
 * C5: Make removeLine Deterministic
 * C6: Update shuffle

# Grading
Your submission will be graded as follows: 
* 10 points: correctness
* 15 points: completeness
* 5 points: style 
* 5 points: elegance
* 5 points: clarity 
* 10 points: peer review

See the [Grading Guidelines](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2015/Admin/wiki/Grading-Guidelines) wiki page for more information about what we're looking for in each of those categories. 

The grutors will also provide written comments on your code's style and elegance.

# Resources 
* See the *[GitHub How To](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2015/Admin/wiki/Setting-Up-Your-Repository) wiki page* for details on how to set up this assignment. 
* See the updated wiki page on [Compiling C++ Code](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2015/Admin/wiki/CompilingHowTo) for even more information about compiling code, including a section on separate compilation. 
* Help each other out! If you have resources or tips for other teams, add them to the [Hints and Tips](https://github.com/hmc-cs70-fall2015/Admin/wiki/Homework-2-Hints-and-Tips) page for this assignment. 

# Helpful Hints
* *Pair Programming:* Remember, your must work on the following as a pair, including the written part.  You can (and should) read this assignment writeup and think about it before you meet, however.
* *Commit Early, Commit Often:* Remember to check in your files regularly!  In particular, don't forget to check them in when you're finished.
* As a general rule (even outside CS 70!), *you should not add generated files* of any form (e.g., compiled code, PDFs made from LaTeX, etc) to a repository when those files can be automatically produced from files already in the repository. 
* *Doxygen:* The C++ files are commented in `Doxygen` format. `Doxygen` is a tool that can automatically generate HTML or LaTeX documentation from C++ files. In future assignments, we will ask you to write your own Doxygen comments and to use Doxygen to generate documentation. For now, it's important only that you keep all the comments in your code up to date. You don't need to worry too much about the format of Doxygen comments in your code, nor do you need to generate Doxygen documentation.
